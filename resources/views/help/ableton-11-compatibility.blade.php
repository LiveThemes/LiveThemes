        <h3>Are the themes from LiveThemes compatible with Ableton 11?</h3>

        <p><strong>Yes they do work.... mostly!</strong> Any themes you've already created will work with Ableton 11 however some of the new features may still have their default colour as we haven't worked these elements into the editor just yet.</p>

    <div class="mb-5">

        <h3>When will new Ableton 11 elements be added to the editor?</h3>

        <p>We're working on it! With every bit of free time we have we're working on adding those new features into the editor so you can customise themes. There will be a good number of people who want to stay with Ableton 10 so we want to make sure we don't break any compatability with that, whilst still adding in the new features - basically now double the work ;)</p>
